# Ecommerce Microfrontends: Ecommerce Clone with Microfrontends

Ecommerce Microfrontends is a project that demonstrates the concept of microfrontends by building a Ecommerce clone with 3 separate React projects and 1 Vue project that seamlessly work together to create a complete web application. 

See [Demo](https://d2t58ozwakllo5.cloudfront.net/).

## **Overview**

Thousands of other engineers have learned microfrontends, and we can too. This project uses a **time-tested, battle-proven** method to make sure we understand exactly how microfrontends work, and will get we a new job working as a software engineer or help we build that app we've always been dreaming about.

**The difference between this project and all the others:** we will understand the design patterns used by top companies to build massively popular web apps.

**Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps.** This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

1. Author smaller, easier to understand codebases
2. Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!
3. Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting our users
4. Allow each of our engineering teams to work independently

This new architecture is popular, but there is a lot of misinformation online. This project has been developed with input from top engineers to ensure **total technical accuracy**. Additionally, we'll learn how to evaluate whether microservices are a good choice for our application.

This project features hundreds of videos with **dozens of custom diagrams** to help you understand how microfrontends work. No prior experience is necessary. Through tireless, patient explanations and many interesting practical examples, you'll learn the fundamentals of building dynamic and live web apps using microfrontends.

Each topic included in this project is added incrementally, to make sure that we have a solid foundation of knowledge. We'll find plenty of discussion added in to help we understand exactly when and where to use each aspect of microfrontends.

Below is a ***partial list*** of the topics we'll find in this project:

- Learn **design patterns** used by the largest companies in the world
- Understand **when to use** microfrontends
- Link multiple apps together using a **tiered routing system**
- **Scope CSS** on our page to prevent cross-app contamination
- Avoid sharing state between apps to **promote isolation**
- **Deploy each portion** of our app independently to avoid production bugs
- Scaffold a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate our release process
- Utilize **multiple front-end frameworks** in the same app
- Maximize performance by using **module federation**

## **Getting Started**

To get started with microfrontends and run the project locally, run the same for each package:

```bash
cd packages/...
```
Install the packages:
```bash
npm install
```
And start the project
```bash
npm run start
```

and open [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080/) in the browser.
